##Hi I'm Rachael!


I am a front end web developer based in Bristol. I have been training with _Nology on their self-paced course around being a full time mum. 


I have been learning, HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript and React. We have also been learning skills using Git and general working practices such as Agile.


###Some of my projects to look at include:

* [React page which used the Punk API](https://github.com/rstevens92/ReactPunkIpaChallenge "React Punk API")
* [Javascript Morse Code Translator](https://github.com/rstevens92/morse-code-challenge "Morse Code Translator")
