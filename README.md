Hi I'm Rachael!

I am a front end web developer based in Bristol. I have been training with _Nology on their self-paced course around being a full time mum. 

I have been learning, HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript and React. We have also been learning skills using Git and general working practices such as Agile.

Some of my projects to look at include
